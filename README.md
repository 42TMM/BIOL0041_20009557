# BIOL0041_20009557
R scripts and Python Scripts used for the Workflow of detecting bats, clustering them and running ecological models on these clusters.

Jupyter Notebooks are included which contain code to run the Python API of BatDetect2 over multiple files within a dataset and produce a dataframe of the outputs of the model. 
Followed by clustering models and plotting of spectrograms. 

Three R Scripts are included, one for running GLMM models on bat call data, one for running occupancy models on the same data and one for any exploratory plots used.
